## üîß Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## üìù Environment Variables Template

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/rozgaar

# JWT Secret (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
JWT_SECRET=your-32-character-hex-string

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api

# File Upload
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
UPLOAD_DIR=./public/uploads
```
